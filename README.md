# Project-OP-Beginning-Scene
The Begining Scene For Project OP

Project OP is a game made by a handful of teenagers under it's founder and manager Ilo

This is the first part of the game and is mainly going to be used for testing

We are not going to release to full game on github because we are afraid of people pirating the game (even though there are a million different way to still pirate it), but the main reason is that we have several secrets hidden in the game and we want to keep them secret until you actully play the game.

The game is planned for a 2024 release date on steam and itch.io with a price tag of about $5
